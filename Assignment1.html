                        <h2>Forms</h2>

                            for you to fill in information. HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer
                            to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors
                            to your site.

                            appear. For Example,you can specify the background of the page is cream,all 
                            paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface

                        Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout,while inline boxes
                        flow between surrounding text.</p>
